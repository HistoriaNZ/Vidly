Learning C# MVC with Bootstrap/Entity. Second iteration w/ user authentication

Project to learn .NET MVC by building a small video/DVD rental application. Source: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-aspnet-mvc-5-course/learn/v4/overview

Packages/Technologies used:

* AutoMapper (for mapping DTOs to model objects and vice-versa).
* BootBox (JavaScript library for simple dialog boxes).
* BootStrap (front-end HTML, CSS and JS library).
* BootStrap DatePicker (Calendar drop-down - added to project but currently not working).
* Elmah (error logging for back-end).
* Entity Framework (for mapping domain models to the DB).
* Glimpse (for debugging requests - probably this app's most useful plugin!)
* ASP.Net Razor (introduces C# to front-end views).
* Typeahead (nifty JS library for creating front-end auto-complete drop-downs).
* Toastr (JS library for displaying notifications)
